jQuery-isotope for Meteor (including centered masonry)

# jQuery-isotope
_Current version: 1.5.25_

A full documentation, including examples, is available on the [Isotope documentation page](http://isotope.metafizzy.co).

This library includes the "centered masonry" layout by default.  Remove centeredMasonry.js to disable that layout. I also used only the parts of the css that related directly to Isotope, since there was a lot of unrelated stuff in there, as well as styles specific to Isotope's website.
